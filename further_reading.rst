Further Information
===================

 * Consider checking David's blog site, located at http://davidjb.com/ - it may just have the information you're looking for.  Depending on David's comprehensiveness, he might have information still lurking around on his old wiki site at http://wiki.davidjb.com/ .  That said, information will be moved in time to his new site.

 * These resources are also your friends:

   * `Google <http://www.google.com>`_ is your friend.  With the right search terms and sometimes, some perseverance, you'll probably find the information you're looking for.
   * The `Plone.org Support forum <http://plone.org/support/forums/>`_ is your friend.  You'll need a Nabble account, but it's well worth it.  There's a wealth of knowledge in people's heads and people are always happy to help.
   * The official Plone IRC channel is an excellent on-demand location to communicate with the main developers of the core of Plone itself.  You should obtain an IRC client, and connect to:

     * **Server:** irc.freenode.net
     * **Channel:** #plone
