===================

Official support channels
-------------------------

Plone, Zope, and its third party addons used in the creation of the DRI site
are all open-source projects, and are all community supported.  Being open
source means more transparency, as compared to other proprietary platforms.
This also means that any security or bug-related issues can be handled by the
community, rather than needing to rely on a single company to release a fix.

If you do need some degree of support, consider the following sources of free
information:

* `Plone's own homepage <http://plone.org>`_, where you can browse to find
  tutorials, FAQs, and other documentation.  In particular, the `Plone manuals
  <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/>`_ are very useful.  The Plone
  Community Developer Documentation is one outstanding example of such a resource.

* `Plone.org Support forum <http://plone.org/support/forums/>`_ is extremely
  useful.  You will need to sign up for a Nabble account to ask questions.
  Plone experts, users, and developers read and respond to these forums, and
  people are always happy to help.

* Official Plone IRC channel.  This is an excellent on-demand location to
  communicate with the main developers of the core of Plone itself and
  other users alike.  You should obtain an IRC client, and connect to:

      * **Server:** irc.freenode.net
      * **Channel:** #plone

Third-party support
-------------------

Consider these third-party sources of support:

* `David's blog site <http://davidjb.com/>`_ - it may just have the information you're 
  looking for.  Depending on David's comprehensiveness, he might have information still 
  lurking around on his `old wiki site <http://wiki.davidjb.com/>`_.  That said, information 
  will be moved in time to his new site.

* Other public blogs devoted to Plone.  If you use a search engine, you'll find a
  variety of blogs dedicated to presenting information about all aspects of Plone.

* These resources are also your friends:

  * `Google <http://www.google.com>`_ is your friend.  With the right search terms and sometimes, some perseverance, you'll probably find the information you're looking for.
  * The `Plone.org Support forum <http://plone.org/support/forums/>`_ is your friend.  You'll need a Nabble account, but it's well worth it.  There's a wealth of knowledge in people's heads and people are always happy to help.
  * The official Plone IRC channel is an excellent on-demand location to communicate with the main developers of the core of Plone itself.  You should obtain an IRC client, and connect to:

     * **Server:** irc.freenode.net
     * **Channel:** #plone

* Paid support is also available from a variety of companies across the world. A listing of 
  some of these is located on `Plone.net <http://plone.net/>`_, where you can search for 
  a suitable provider.
