In this diagram, the typical port allocations are detailed beneath the relevant service name.  Also, please note that this is just a general overview of the system and doesn't being to take into account aspects like where these services should physically reside or similar points.  In this example, the services could live all on one virtual machine, or could be spread across five or more physical computers.
